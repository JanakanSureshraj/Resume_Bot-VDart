This project is aimed at automating specific components to automate the hiring process of the company. 

## Audio Transcription Component
Built using FastAPI and leverages the WhisperX library, an enhanced speech-to-text model based on OpenAI's Whisper, for accurate audio transcription. The application is designed to handle file uploads, save them temporarily using Python’s os module, and perform real-time transcription using PyTorch (torch) on a GPU (cuda) or CPU, depending on availability. The model operates in "int8" precision mode for optimized memory usage, and the transcribed text is returned in a structured JSON format. The API features include file handling, error management, and auto-generated documentation through FastAPI’s Swagger UI (/docs - allowing users to interact with the API and test the endpoints). The entire setup ensures efficient transcription with minimal resource usage and is ideal for automating audio-to-text tasks in large-scale applications.

## Resume Summarization Component
Uses FastAPI to expose endpoints for processing PDF resumes. The PyPDF2 library extracts text from PDF files, and the Google Gemini AI service (GenAI) generates structured summaries. The gemini-1.5-flash model outputs the summary text in a predefined format with fields such as Years of Experience, Skills, Experiences, Projects, and Awards. spaCy is then used to parse the AI-generated summary, breaking it down into structured fields for further use in database operations or file creation. MongoDB is used to store the extracted data. The application integrates with DigitalOcean Spaces using Boto3 to download the PDF file from the first bucket using the provided filekey (file name) and uploads the generated summary as a text file to the second bucket after processing. This component automates the end-to-end process of summarizing resumes, ensuring seamless data management with MongoDB and efficient workflow automation.
